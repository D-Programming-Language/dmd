To report a problem or browse the list of open bugs, please visit the
[bug tracker](http://issues.dlang.org/).

For more information, including instructions for compiling, installing, and

Walter and Andrei have veto rights when it comes to inclusion of new stuff into DMD, druntime, and phobos. So if you're looking to work on new stuff either pick something from the [list](https://wiki.dlang.org/Walter_Andrei_Action_List). Or get in contact with Walter or Andrei early during the design phase of your project. This way you can avoid a lot of frustration, by not having your project rejected after you already implemented it.
