Alias this fix has now become the default

Prior to this release there was an alias this bug where
[alias this was not considered when doing scope](https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16082).
[The issue was fixed but put behind a preview switch](https://github.com/dlang/dmd/pull/8885).
Starting with this release, the fix becomes the default.
