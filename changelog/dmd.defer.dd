Added `defer` as a shortened alternative for `scope(exit)`

You can now use `defer` as shortened alternative to `scope(exit)`, useful when you do not use exception handling (-betterC / wasm) since you have no use for the other two, namely `scope(success)` `scope(failure)`


```
void task()
{
    auto file = create_file("myfile.txt");
    defer file.close();

    file.write();
}
```
