`while (auto n = expression)` is now supported

Up until this release, `while (auto n = expression)` was not
supported, although the `if` counterpart: `if (auto n = expression)`
compiled succesfully. Starting with the current compiler version,
`while (auto n = expression)` is accepted, having the exact
same semantics as:

---
while (true)
{
    if (auto n = expression)
    { /* loop body */ }
    else
    { break; }
}
---
