Add `__traits(allTargetInfos)` to query the set of targetInfo data available from the backend.

`allTargetInfos` evaluates to a tuple of strings containing all keys accepted by the implementation.

---
static assert([ __traits(allTargetInfos) ] == [ "cppRuntimeLibrary", "targetTriple", ... ]) // not a true list
---

Keys are implementation defined, allowing relevant data for exotic targets. A reliable subset which are always available shall be mentioned in the spec.
