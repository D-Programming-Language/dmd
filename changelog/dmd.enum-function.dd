Functions can no longer have `enum` storage class

`enum` on a function declaration had no effect other than being
equivalent to the `auto` storage class when no return type was present.
That syntax could be confused with `enum` manifest constants and is
now an error:
---
enum void f1() { }  // error
enum f2() { }       // error
---

Instead, remove `enum` and use `auto` where necessary:
---
void f1() { }
auto f2() { }
---
