DMD will now prefer a `dmd.conf` or `sc.ini` in the argv0 directory over the `dmd.conf` in the home directory

The sequence of the inifile lookup has been changed to this order:

$(OL
  $(LI current directory)
  $(LI exe directory (windows))
  $(LI directory of argv0)
  $(LI home directory)
  $(LI SYSCONFDIR=/etc (non-windows))
)

Most importantly, the argv0 directory is now checked before the home directory.
