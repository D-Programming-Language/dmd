Allow verbose output to be redirected to a file

Enhanced the "-v" option to accept a filename to redirect verbose output to a file, i.e.
---
dmd -v=info.txt ...
---
This is useful for tools that invoke the compiler and use the verbose output but want do not want to redirect stdout/stderr so that error messages and other information can still get to the user.
