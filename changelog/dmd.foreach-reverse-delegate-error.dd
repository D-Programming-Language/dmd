`foreach_reverse` on a delegate is now an error

The compiler did not try to implement reverse traversal of the results returned by
the delegate when $(D foreach_reverse) was used. That could result in code
that was confusing to read, so it was deprecated (for many years). Using
$(D foreach_reverse) with a delegate is now an error.
