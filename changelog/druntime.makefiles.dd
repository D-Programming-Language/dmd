Makefiles cleanup for druntime

The `{posix,win32,win64}.mak` Makefiles have been merged to a generic `Makefile` (including the ones in `druntime/test/`). `posix.mak` is kept as a deprecated forwarder for now.

On Windows, you can/need to use the generic Makefile too - with a GNU make (and a git installation providing bash and GNU tools). Windows devs can finally exploit parallelism via `-j`! (Version [4.2.1](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/make-4.2.1.tar.bz2) is the latest version coming with a Visual Studio `.sln`, to quickly build it yourself.)
