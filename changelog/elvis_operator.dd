Add support for the elvis operator (?:)

The elvis operator is a particularization of the ternary operator
that returns its first operand if the operand is true, otherwise
evaluates and returns the second operand
-------
void main()
{
    int x = 0;
    int y = 7;
    assert((x ?: y) == y);
    assert((y ?: x) == y);
}
