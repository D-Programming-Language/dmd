Deprecate logical NOT in bitwise binary expressions

If a logical NOT operator is used for the left operand of a bitwise binary
expression, parentheses should be added to explicitly indicate the intended
order of operations:

---
int a, b;
...
auto w = !a & b;     // Deprecated
auto x = (!a) & b;   // OK
auto y = !(a & b);   // OK
auto z = !a && b;    // OK
---

This makes it clear which part of the expression is intended to be affected by
the NOT operator.
