-preview=intpromote switch is now set by default.

Integer promotions now follow C integral promotions rules consistently

It affects operands of type byte/ubyte/short/ushort/char/wchar for `-` and `~`. The operands are promoted to int before the operator is applied.
The result type will now be int.

To revert to the old behavor rewrite it as the following:

~byte as typeof(byte)(~int(byte)) to preserve the old behavior or use -revert=intpromote to revert the changes
