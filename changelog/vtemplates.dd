Add -vtemplates switch to collect and list template statistics

Template instantiations can consume lots of time and memory.
By passing the -vtemplates switch to the compiler,
the compiler will collect and print statistics about template usage
in the code being compiled.

For each template that was instantiated, a list of how many
times it is instantiated, and how many of those instantiations
are unique, is printed.
