Named arguments for functions have been implemented and documented

When calling a function, arguments may be preceded with a parameter name for purposes of clarity and flexible ordering.
Consequently, default arguments need not be at the end of the parameter list anymore.

---
void createWindow(bool fullScreen = false, int width, int height, string title);

void main()
{
    createWindow(title: "Skynet", width: 1280, height: 720);
}
---

Named arguments can also be used in struct/union literals.
A union can now be initialized by setting a field different than the first one.

---
union U
{
    float asFloat;
    uint asInt;
}

auto u0 = U(1.0); // this sets the `asFloat` field
auto u1 = U(asInt: 0x3F800000); // formerly not possible
---

Relevant specification pages are:
$(UL
    $(LI $(DDSUBLINK spec/struct, struct-literal, Struct Literals))
    $(LI $(DDSUBLINK spec/struct, anonymous, Anonymous Structs and Unions))
    $(LI $(DDSUBLINK spec/expression, argument-parameter-matching, Matching Arguments to Parameters))
    $(LI $(DDSUBLINK spec/function, function-overloading, Function Overloading))
)

Note that the implementation for regular functions and struct literals has been around since dmd 2.103, but it was undocumented and wouldn't work with template functions.

This implements [DIP1030](https://www.dlang.org/dips/1030) for *function arguments*, but named *template arguments* are not implemented yet.
Also, there are still implementation details to be ironed out which the DIP doesn't specify, such as how named arguments interact with tuples.
