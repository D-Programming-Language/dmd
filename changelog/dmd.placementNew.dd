# Added Placement New Expression

Placement new explicitly provides the storage for NewExpression to initialize
with the newly created value, rather than using the GC.

struct S
{
    float d;
    int i;
    char c;
}

void main()
{
    S s;
    S* p = new (s) S(); // place new object into s
    assert(p.i == 0 && p.c == 0xFF);
}
