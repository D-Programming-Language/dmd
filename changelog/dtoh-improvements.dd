Improvements for the C++ header generation

The following features/bugfixes/improvements were implemented for the
experimental C++ header generator:

- The implicitly generated context pointer for nested aggregates is now
  emitted as `outer` instead of `this`


Note: The header generator is still considered experimental, so please submit
      any bugs encountered to [the bug tracker](https://issues.dlang.org).
