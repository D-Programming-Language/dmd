The `$` expression is now accepted in array accessed via `.ptr`

The `.ptr` property can be used to bypass bounds checking in array accesses.
The downside is that the indexes cannot use the `$` shortand.

From this version the `$` will be accepted if the array is given by a variable.

```
void v(ref int[] a)
in (a.length)
do
{
    // previously
    a.ptr[a.length - 1] = 0;
    // now
    a.ptr[$-1] = 0;
}
```
