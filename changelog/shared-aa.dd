`shared` associate arrays are deprecated

Starting from this release shared associative arrays are deprecated.
Associative array don't support the `shared` API and generate violation access errors.

As a workaround it's possible to declare them `__ghsared` and, in a multi threaded context,
protect the accesses with a synchronization barrier.
