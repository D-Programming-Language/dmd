Members called `init` are now deprecated

This applies to named enum types and structs / classes with `extern (D)` linkage.
They conflict with the built-in `.init` property of types, complicating meta-programming.
As a corrective action, rename them to something like `initial` or `initialize`.

enum E
{
    init, // deprecated
    initial, // corrective action
}

struct S
{
    void init() { } // deprecated
    void initialize() { } // corrective action
}
