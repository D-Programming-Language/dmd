Object file extensions `.o` and `.obj` are now accepted on all platforms

Accepting .o and .obj file extensions on all platforms makes DMD behave
the same as Clang and other modern compilers. There is no point in
discarding *.o or *.obj depending on the current OS, as both extensions
indicate that this is an object file.
