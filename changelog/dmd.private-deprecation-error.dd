Deprecation phase ended for access to private method when overloaded with public method.

When a private method was overloaded with a public method that came after it,
you could access the private overload as if it was public.

After a deprecation period starting with 2.094, this code is now an error.

Example:

```
struct Foo
{
    private void test(int) { }
    public void test(string) { }
}
...
Foo().test(3);
```
