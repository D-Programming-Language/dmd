ImportC has improved Unicode support

Universal Character Names are now supported, allowing you to use the ``\uXXXX`` and ``\UXXXXXXXX`` syntax where ``X`` is a hex digit as part of an identifier.

DigitalMars sppn does not support anything newer than C99.
It is known to be limited and using any Unicode character not in those ranges will result in an error.
