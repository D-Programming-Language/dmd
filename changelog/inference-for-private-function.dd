`private` functions now have their attributes inferred

In order to reduce the amount of attributes users have to apply to their code,
`private` functions will now have their attributes inferred as templates
or `auto` functions currently do.

E.g. the following is now possible:
---
private void bar() {}

void foo() @safe nothrow @nogc pure {
  bar();
}
---
