The shortened method syntax is now available by default.

[DIP 1043---Shortened Method Syntax](https://forum.dlang.org/thread/ahswpyijfidyorixgaqm@forum.dlang.org) has been accepted, the flag `-preview=shortenedMethods`
is no longer required to write shortened function bodies:

---
int add(int x, int y) pure => x + y;

// equivalent full function body:
int add(int x, int y) pure
{
    return x + y;
}
---

The preview flag will still work until it is deprecated in a future release.
