Added `__MANGLED_FUNCTION__` special keywords

This special keyword will allow the usage of the mangled function symbol on
situations where `mixin(callee).mangleof` don't work.

e.g. when you have a nested function, you can't do:

---
void main()
{
    void foo()
    {
        mixin(__FUNCTION__).mangleof.writeln;
    }
}
---
