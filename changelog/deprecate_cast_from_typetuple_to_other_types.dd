Deprecated casting from TypeTuple to other types

The result of casting from TypeTuple to other types is puzzling.

---
TypeTuple!(int, int) values;
auto values2 = cast(long)values;
// typeof(values2) == TypeTuple!(int, int)

// Only when the casted tuple is immediately expanded.
auto arr = [cast(long)values];
// typeof(arr) == long[]
