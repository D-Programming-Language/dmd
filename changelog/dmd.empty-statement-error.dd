Using `;` as an empty statement has been turned into an error

This has been deprecated since 2.075.0 because it's error prone:

---
void main()
{
    foreach (i; 0 .. 8);
    {
        // Because of the accidental semicolon above,
        // this block statement is executed once.
        // It's not the loop body
    }
}
---

It will now result in an error.

$(CONSOLE
app.d(3): Error: use `{ }` for an empty statement, not `;`
)
