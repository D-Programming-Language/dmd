Unsafe code can now be used in debug blocks

When writing debug code, one isn't interested in the type safety, but a pleasant
debugging experience.
The type checker already allowed to escape `pure` and `@nogc` within `debug`
statement.
With this release, `@system` code can be called from `debug` statements too:

---
void main()
{
    int[] arr = [1, 2];
    debug unsafeCode(arr);
}

@system void unsafeCode(T)(T[] arr)
{
    import core.stdc.stdio;
    printf("arr.ptr: %p", arr.ptr);
}
---
