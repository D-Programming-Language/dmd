Deprecate marking class methods as `synchronized` while class is not synchronized

The D language specification states that member functions of non-`synchronized` classes cannot be marked as `synchonized`, however the compiler does not reject such declarations. The following code compiled before the patch:

---
class S
{
    synchronized void fun() { }
}
---

After applying the patch, the above code will issue a deprecation message
