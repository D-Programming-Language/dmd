Allow shortened function implementations for single-expresssion functions.

`-preview=shortenedMethods` is added. This allows functions to be written in a similar form to lambda functions:

---
// these 2 are equivalent
int foo() { return 1; }
int foo() => 1;
---

The syntax allows the form `=> expr` to replace the function body `{ return expr; }`
