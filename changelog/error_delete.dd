`delete` expressions is now obsolete

$(LINK2 https://dlang.org/spec/expression.html#delete_expressions, Delete expressions) are now obsolete.

Prior to this release, usage of a delete expression would result in a deprecation warning.  Starting with
this release it will result in an error.

Use $(LINK2 https://dlang.org/phobos/object.html#.destroy, `destroy`)
(and $(LINK2 https://dlang.org/phobos/core_memory.html#.GC.free, `core.memory.GC.free()` if applicable) instead.
Use $(LINK2 https://dlang.org/phobos/core_memory.html#.__delete, `core.memory.__delete` as a last resort.

See the $(LINK2 https://dlang.org/deprecate.html#delete, deprecated features page) for more information.
