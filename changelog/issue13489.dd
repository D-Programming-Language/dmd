Boolean semantic of floating point now respects NaN

Before this change, the following assert would pass:
---
assert(double.nan);
---
While this is keeping with C and C++ semantic,
it was also at odds with the rest of the language
and unintuitive.
Using floating point numbers (`float`, `double`, `real`)
as boolean will now be equivalent to checking for `NaN`
and for `0.0[f]`.
