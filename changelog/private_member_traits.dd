Enable private member access for traits

The following traits can now access non-public members:
$(UL
    $(LI hasMember)
    $(LI getMember)
    $(LI getOverloads)
    $(LI getVirtualMethods)
    $(LI getVirtualFunctions)
)

This fixes a long-standing issue in D where the allMembers trait would correctly return non-public members but those non-public members would be inaccessible to other traits.
