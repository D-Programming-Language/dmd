Throwing qualified objects is now deprecated

Previously, an `immutable`, `const` or `inout` exception could be
thrown and then caught in a `catch (Exception e)` clause.
Throwing a qualified object is now deprecated. This helps to prevent
possible mutation of an immutable object in a `catch` clause.

The runtime also modifies a thrown object (e.g. to contain a stack
trace) which can violate `const` or `immutable` objects. Throwing
qualified objects have been deprecated for this reason also.
