Usage of the `body` keyword has been deprecated

Using `body` to indicate the body of a function or method
in the presence of contracts is now deprecated.
Any leftover usage of `body` can be replaced with `do`.
This replacement, introduced by $(LINK2 https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/blob/master/DIPs/accepted/DIP1003.md, DIP1003),
has been available since $(LINK2 https://github.com/dlang/dmd/pull/6855, DMD v2.075.0 (July 2017)).
