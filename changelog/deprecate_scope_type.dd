`scope` as a type constraint is deprecated.

`scope` as a type constraint has been deprecated for quite some time.  However,
starting with this release, the compiler will emit a deprecation warning if used.

---
scope class C { }  // Deprecation: `scope` as a type constraint is deprecated.  Use `scope` at the usage site.
