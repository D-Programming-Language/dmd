Deprecate the use of private selectively imported members

The spec highlights clearly that a private member is visible
only from within the same module. Due to a bug, selectively
imported private members were visible from other modules. This
represents a severe violation of the private keyword specification.
At this point the use of selectively imported private members has
been deprecated and should be transformed into an error as soon
as possible.
