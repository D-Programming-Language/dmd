`static assert` now supports multiple message arguments

When the condition evaluates to false, any subsequent expressions will
each be converted to string and then concatenated. The resulting string
will be printed out along with the error diagnostic.
---
enum e = 3;
static assert(false, "a = ", e);
---
Will print:
$(CONSOLE
file.d(2): Error: static assert:  a = 3
)
