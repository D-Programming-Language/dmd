`foreach` on a dynamic array can have an index type smaller than `size_t`

The array length is known at compile-time for the following cases:

* The array is a literal
* The array is a slice expression whose upper bound is known at
  compile-time

For an array `a`, the index type can be any integer type `I` where
`a.length <= I.max`.

Other cases [are not implemented](https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24542) yet.
