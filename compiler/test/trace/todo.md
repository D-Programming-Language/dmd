- Do we need both `tracingEnabled` and `Param.trace`?
- Make behavior be controlled via the `-trace` flag because I believe this is
  gonna be the most productive way of interaction. For instance
  - `dmd -trace=sum:Function,Type;file:trace`
  - `-trace=all:Template`
  - `-trace=file:SOME_FILE`
- Discuss traceFile naming. Shall we add automatically add a timestamp to the file name?
- Adjusting symbol casings
- Write the mangled names to save space
- Filter on trace types during writing
- Make the global pointer to array a normal array instead
